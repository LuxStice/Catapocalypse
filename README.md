## 📜 About the Game

**[Game Title]** is a hybrid **4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate)** and **RTS survival** game set in a dying world.

  Scout ruins, recover lost tech, and reveal the secrets of the world.

- 🔬 **Tech Tree & Research**  
  Choose between survival tools, military might, or civic improvements.
