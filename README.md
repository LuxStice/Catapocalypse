## 🐱 What is Catapocalypse?

In **Catapocalypse**, you lead a colony of intelligent, industrious cats who are trying to build a new home in a world overrun by zombies. But there’s a twist: zombies are drawn to **sound and smell** — and cats are *not great at hiding either*. 😸

Build, gather, purr, and fight to survive. Manage how your town smells and sounds, or the undead will sniff you out.
